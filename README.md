Hi, I am Ryan Cheah, a water resources engineer (specializing in computational hydraulics).

My core skills include:
-Building numeric models for various water resources applications (rainfall runoff, flood risk, hydropower and groundwater)
-Geospatial data manipulation and visualization with Geographic Information Systems (GIS)
-Data analysis, data manipulation and machine learning in Python

I am currently working on incorporating more data science techniques like deep learning to improve on existing conventional modelling techniques in the water resources industry.
